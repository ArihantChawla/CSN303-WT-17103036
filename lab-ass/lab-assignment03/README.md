Submission for assignment 3 of Web Tech course by
**Arihant Chawla (17103036).**
Unlike my previous assignments, I had to do this on an _offline compiler_.
This code has been checked on an _Ubuntu 18.04 LTS machine_. This JAVA applet should also ideally run on Windows but I have not tested it on the same.  

Pl. run the following commands to test the program:

1. export CLASSPATH=.:./lib/jsoup-1.13.1.jar$CLASSPATH
2. javac Main.java
3. java Main

Cheers :)
