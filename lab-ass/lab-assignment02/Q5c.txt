As we can see, for very small inputs, using a hashset performs better (on average) than implementing a hash table using an Array object.

This is particularly true for intersection and complement. For union, however, an array implementation performs better.

All in all, since the input size was so small (11 elements in the universal set), any discussion related to execution time is ultimately futile.

A good way to measure the same would have been to vary the size of U to 11, 101, 1001 and so on and recording the difference and thus plotting a comparatove graph of Array vs HashSet.

The results from Q5a and Q5b for the same input is present in the files Q5a.png and Q5b.png, rerspectively.
