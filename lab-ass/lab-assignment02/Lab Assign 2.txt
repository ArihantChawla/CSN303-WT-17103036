Assignment-2 (WT)
[done]1. Write a java program to compare two strings lexicographically (without using library function).
[done]2. Write a program to implement counting sort (with input in the range 0 to 20 and input can be repeated multiple times)
[done]3. Write a program to sort strings (without using library function).
[done]4. Find the smallest n such that Σi = i^2 where 1 ≤ i ≤ n is too large to be represented as an int.
5. Let us define a couple of sets of integers, and let Java compute the set-theoretical operations (union, intersection and complement). We first fix our universe, which will consist of the 11 elements, Universe = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, A and B will be entered by users.
    a. Only array can be used as data structure
    b. Using any efficient data-structure available in Java
    c. Compare the time to compute the operations 
[done]6. Write a ConsoleProgram that reads in a number from the user and then displays the Hailstone sequence for that number (Pick some positive integer and call it n. If n is even, divide it by two. If n is odd, multiply it by three and add one. Continue this process until n is equal to one)
